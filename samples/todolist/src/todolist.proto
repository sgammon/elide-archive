//
// ### API Invocation
// Two styles of API are provided as part of this service:
// - **REST/RPC**: You can dispatch the API with REST-ful JSON or gRPC. In this dispatch style, all operations are unary
//   and function with strong consistency (as long as the underlying data store makes such guarantees for transactions).
// - **Streaming**: Where supported, the client may also use the long-form streaming method, which has the advantage of
//   supporting server-generated task/task-list change events. In this mode, each front-end "session" subscribes to the
//   proper spot in Firestore server-side, and exchanges both updates and changes as needed on a duplex basis until the
//   session closes.
//
// ### Authentication
// Firstly, the frontend client must obtain and affix a valid and un-expired/un-revoked API key, duly authorized to use
// the API being exposed. Secondly, the client must obtain a user authorization token, via the normal Firebase means.
// These values must be attached to each unary API request, or the beginning of a streaming session, as described below:
//
// #### Affixing the API key
// The API key identifies the application which is originating API traffic. It is generally restricted by referrer (when
// used in a web context), or IP address (for servers), or by Android/iOS bundle ID. You can learn more about how Google
// works with API keys [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys).
//
// How you affix the API key depends on your invocation style:
// - **REST/RPC**: You may use one or both of the following options:
//    - **`X-API-Key` Header**: Specify the key, verbatim, in the header `X-API-Key`.
//    - **`key` Parameter**: Specify the key, verbatim, in the query parameter `key`.
// - **gRPC**: Affix the API key as a string metadata entry, at the name `x-api-key`.
//
// #### Affixing the auth token
// The *authorization token* identifies the end-user who is using the Todolist application to the API, and contains a
// cryptographic payload which enables access to their data, on their behalf. It is a JWT but must be treated as an
// opaque value, and can be obtained via normal means using [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).
//
// After obtaining a token, or checking that one on-hand is not expired, it is affixed depending on your desired API
// invocation style:
// - **REST/RPC**: Attach the token in the `Authorization` header, prefixed with the type token `Bearer`, and separated
//   by a single space.
// - **gRPC**: Attach the token in a string metadata entry called `authorization`, prefixed with the type token `Bearer`
//   and separated by a single space.
//
// #### Token expiration & renewal
// By default, authorization tokens expire in a maximum of *1 (one) wall-clock hour*, so, it is imperative in the front-
// end client that the expiration be checked before use, or that code is written to react to *403 Forbidden* responses
// as a result of expired authorization tokens. API keys do not expire.
//
// To renew a token, use the methods defined in Firebase Auth for the platform you're on. All platforms allow some form
// of token refresh/renewal.
//
// ### Streaming vs. Polling
// To accomplish the real-time nature of the Todolist app, this API supports a streaming interface (described above).
// When using the streaming interface, changes occur and propagate essentially in realtime. When and where the streaming
// interface is not supported or desired, the end-user can opt for polling. In this case, it is recommended to check for
// new tasks or task changes every *5 seconds*, using the `Changelog` method.
service Tasks {
  option (google.api.default_host) = "todolist.elide.tools";

  // Execute a simple health check against the `Tasks` service. Perform any local logic needed to ensure the service is
